What if we want to implement obstacle avoidance for the same enemy,
what would we add, remove, or change? Explain what you would do.


	In the case of projectiles, add an additional mesh collider (sphere)
and have the actor move when a hazardous projectile enters said collider.
In the case of environment, such as obstructing terrain, the enemy would
require a collision detection with blocking mesh. If obstructing mesh is
identified, enemy priority changes to navigating obstacle instead of
previous objective.


-----------------------------------------


If we want to make the enemy actor controllable, how would we change
the component system for the enemy? Explain what would change.

	Actor class variables that dictate whether or not its children are treated
as enemy or ally e.g. can/cannot be hit by player, can/cannot pickup items.
Actor components would then be able to toggle these variables based on whether
or not it is friend or foe.
